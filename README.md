# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The application fetches data correctly, but the FlatList remains empty.

## Problem

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a public API. While the data is successfully fetched, the FlatList does not display it.  The component shows 'Loading...' then nothing after the data arrives. No errors are thrown in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is properly structured and handled by the FlatList.  This often involves checking data types and potential inconsistencies between the fetched data and the FlatList's expectations.

The solution file provides a fix for the problem described above.
